# Pneumonia Detection TensorFlow and Keras 

## 1.	Image Classification

Using Convolutional Neural Network. We will build a model to predict whether a person has ‘pneumonia’ based on X-Rays images. 
The model is created inside TensorFlow using a package called KERAS. In simple word what CNN does is, it extracts the feature of image and convert it into lower dimension without losing its characteristics.

## 2.	The Data 

I am using a dataset collected through Kaggle. It is free and you can find it here:

                            https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

* The data has about 6000 X-Rays images.
* It is divided into 3 files: TRAIN, TEST and VALIDATION
* In each file I was able to find 2 classes: ‘NORMAL’ and ‘PNEUMONIA’

## 3.	Environment and Tools

I am working with Python programming language inside Jupyter Notebook. inside this project I worked with the following tools:

* TensorFlow 
* Keras
* Numpy
* Matplotlib.pyplot
* Lime

## 4.	Results 

#### We achieved a final prediction accuracy of .90 for our test data, indicating predictions of 90% correct on average.
